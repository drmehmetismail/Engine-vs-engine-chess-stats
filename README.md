# Engine-vs-engine Chess Stats

## Scripts
1. `eval_corrector_ccrl.py`: Inputs the PGN file with evals from the CCRL dataset and outputs a PGN file with corrected evals, where all evals are from white's perspective.
2. `pgn_engine_vs_engine_analyzer.py`: Inputs the PGN file generated by eval_corrector_ccrl.py and outputs a JSON file with calculations of various stats such as GI, GPL, and ACPL for each game.
3. `json_to_csv_converter.py`: Converts JSON data to CSV format for aggregated chess game stats.
4. `csv_to_player_stats.py`: Inputs the CSV file generated by json_to_csv_converter.py and outputs a CSV with player (engine) specific stats.
5. `chess_stats_summarizer.py`: Inputs the CSV file generated by json_to_csv_converter.py and outputs a summary stats.
6. `main.py`: Main script to run the entire data processing pipeline.

## Additional scripts

7. `split_large_pgn.py`: # Splits large PGN file into smaller files based on size and content
9. `player_stats_summarizer.py`: Inputs the CSV file generated by csv_to_player_stats.py and outputs a summary stats.
10. `normalize_gi.py`: Inputs a CSV generated from csv_to_player_stats.py and outputs a CSV with the normalized_gi column using the linear function initially obtained from the normalize_player_stats.py. This script can be used independently for any dataset.


## Usage
Run the `main.py` script to process data through all stages:
